"""Does what a profile claims match where its proxy actually comes out?

A pinned fingerprint keeps a profile's hardware honest. The parts deliberately
left dynamic — timezone, coordinates, the WebRTC address — follow the proxy only
as long as the profile does not override them. A profile that reports
``Europe/Berlin`` while its proxy exits in Tokyo contradicts itself in a way any
page can measure with two lines of JavaScript, and no amount of fingerprint
pinning hides it.

Languages are not in that list. Camoufox applies ``handle_locales`` after its IP
lookup and overwrites ``locale:*`` unconditionally, so a profile's languages
always win — by design here, since an English-language browser is unremarkable
from any country and warning about one would fire on nearly every profile.

This module resolves where a proxy really comes out and compares that with what
the profile would tell a page.
