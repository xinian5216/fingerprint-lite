"""Freeze a profile's fingerprint so it looks like the same machine every time.

Camoufox generates a fresh fingerprint on every launch. That is the right default
for a privacy tool, but it is the opposite of what a profile manager needs: an
account opened from a machine with 12 cores and an NVIDIA GPU should not come
back tomorrow with 32 cores and an AMD GPU.

So the first launch resolves the fingerprint once, and it is stored and replayed
from then on. Camoufox fills a config key only when it is absent (``set_into`` /
``merge_into``), so a stored value always wins over a freshly generated one.

Not everything is frozen. A profile's hardware is an identity and must never
drift; its geolocation, timezone and WebRTC address describe *where it is
connecting from* and must follow the proxy in use. Freezing those would pin a
Berlin timezone onto a profile that later moves to a Tokyo proxy — a mismatch
that is trivial to detect and worse than no spoofing at all.
