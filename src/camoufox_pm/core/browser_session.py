"""Browser session lifecycle: launch, monitor, and close Camoufox instances.

Extracted from ``profile_manager`` so profile CRUD and browser control have
clear, independently testable responsibilities.

Cleanup is driven primarily by Playwright's ``close``/``disconnected`` events, so
a user closing the browser window is detected and the session is torn down. OS
process polling is only a best-effort fallback: with a persistent context the
resolvable pid is Playwright's driver process, not Firefox, so it is not a
reliable window-close signal on its own.
