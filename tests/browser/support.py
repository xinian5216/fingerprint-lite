    A real launch passes `geoip=True`, and Camoufox then asks the internet what
    this machine's public address is. The answer is cached per process, so it is
    one lookup per run rather than one per launch — but a *failed* lookup is not
    cached, so with no internet every launch retries and fails, and the answer
    differs by machine anyway.

    Naming an address keeps the whole path. Camoufox gates only the HTTP lookup
    on `geoip is True`; everything after it — geolocation, timezone, locale, the
    WebRTC candidate and the IPv6 pref that goes with it — runs the same either
    way, against the database on disk. `geoip=False` would take a different
    branch and change what the browser does, which is why it is not used here.

    Left alone when a test set geoip itself; profiles with coordinates turn it
    off, and that is the behaviour under test. Note it also short-circuits the
    lookup Camoufox makes *through a proxy* — no browser test launches with one
    today, and one that did would want its own answer here.
