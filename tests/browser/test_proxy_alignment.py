"""A profile must not tell a page where this computer really is.

Setting coordinates turns Camoufox's geoip off — the only way it keeps them —
and that same branch is what fills the timezone. Without the fill this exercises,
Firefox falls back to the host machine's own zone, which is the real machine
showing through.

The exit address is named rather than looked up. What belongs here is the part
only a browser can answer — that the filled timezone is what Intl reports — and
resolving an address over HTTP is neither that nor deterministic: it was the last
thing in this suite needing the internet, and it made the assertion depend on
where the machine sits. The lookup itself, including endpoints that answer with a
page instead of an address, is covered in tests/unit/test_proxy_check.py.

Run with:  uv run pytest -m browser
