# Command-line reference

## `camoufox-pm`

Runs the API and the web UI as one process on one port, and opens the UI.

```
usage: camoufox-pm [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--no-browser] [--desktop]
                   [--portable] {browser,user,unlock,leases} ...
```

| Flag | Default | What it does |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ |
| `--host HOST` | `127.0.0.1` (or `CPM_HOST`) | Bind address. Anything other than loopback exposes the API to your network — set `CPM_API_KEY` first. |
| `--port PORT` | `8000` (or `CPM_PORT`) | Port to serve on. |
| `--no-browser` | off | Do not open a browser tab on start. Use when running as a service. |
| `--desktop` | off | Open a native window instead of a browser tab. Needs the `desktop` extra. |
| `--portable` | off (on in the packaged app) | Keep the database, profiles, config and logs in a `Data` folder beside the program. |
| `-h`, `--help` | | Show the built-in help. |

The flags win over the environment, and the settings the app reports (including
on the Settings screen) reflect what it actually bound to.

```bash
camoufox-pm                          # http://localhost:8000, opens a browser
camoufox-pm --port 9000 --no-browser # run headless on another port
camoufox-pm --desktop                # native window
```

To stop it, press `Ctrl+C`. Any browsers it launched are closed with it.

## `camoufox-pm browser`

Prepares the fixed Camoufox browser build the program runs. Installs always
verify the pinned SHA256 — there is no way to skip the check and no automatic
upgrade to a newer build. The same verification and the same atomic install
apply whether the bytes come from the network or from a local official ZIP.

```bash
camoufox-pm browser status             # what is installed, and where
camoufox-pm browser install            # reuse, else the Browser folder, else download
camoufox-pm browser install <zip>      # install from an official ZIP you downloaded
camoufox-pm browser install --download # retry the online download explicitly
```

If a download fails — including a slow or blocked connection to GitHub
releases, which some networks throttle — drop the official ZIP into the
`Browser` folder next to the program and restart, or run
`browser install <zip>`: the program does not keep retrying on its own. The
download itself honours the usual `HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` environment
variables. A failed download or extraction never touches an existing browser or
the profile data under `Data/`.

## `camoufox-pm user`

Manages web UI login accounts. **Creating the first account turns login on**:
from then on the API requires a session (or the API key), and the web UI shows
a login screen. Removing the last account turns login back off. Accounts live
in the CLI on purpose — there is no registration endpoint, so creating one
requires shell access to the host, and the first user can be created without a
chicken-and-egg lockout.

```
usage: camoufox-pm user {add,passwd,remove,list} ...
```

| Command | What it does |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `user add <name>` | Create an account. Prompts twice for the password (min 8 characters); it is argon2id-hashed before it touches the database and never appears in argv, the environment, or logs. |
| `user passwd <name>` | Change an account's password. Existing sessions stay valid. |
| `user remove <name>` | Delete an account and its open sessions. Warns when it was the last one. |
| `user list` | List account names and creation times. Never shows hashes. |

`add` and `passwd` take `--password-stdin` to read the password from the first
line of stdin instead of prompting — for provisioning scripts and containers:

```bash
camoufox-pm user add alice                            # interactive
openssl rand -base64 18 | camoufox-pm user add ci-bot --password-stdin
```

The commands work against `CPM_DB_PATH` and take effect immediately, even while
the server is running — the guard checks the database per request.

## `camoufox-pm leases` and `camoufox-pm unlock`

Every browser launch takes a lease on its profile so that two instances sharing
a database cannot open the same one at once (see
[Running more than one instance](../README.md#running-more-than-one-instance)).
These two commands are the operator's view of that.

```bash
camoufox-pm leases                  # id, name, holder, expiry, live or expired
camoufox-pm unlock <profile-id>     # force-release; prompts unless --yes
```

`leases` lists every lease in `CPM_DB_PATH`, including expired ones that nobody
has taken over yet. A holder id is `<hostname>:<pid>:<uuid>`, so it names the
machine and the process to look for.

`unlock` clears a lease whatever it says, and prints who held it. It exists for
the case a lease cannot resolve on its own: a machine that died in a way its
lease could not notice, or one that is verifiably gone and whose TTL you do not
want to wait out. Check `leases` first — force-releasing a lease that is still
live lets a second browser open a profile that is already running, which is the
corruption the lease prevents. There is deliberately no API endpoint for it.

## `camoufox fetch`

Downloads the Camoufox browser (~300 MB). This comes from Camoufox itself, not
from this project, and is required before any profile can be launched.

```bash
camoufox fetch          # installed release
uv run camoufox fetch   # from source
```

Without it the app still runs: you can create and edit profiles, import and export
whole-profile archives from the web UI, and browse the device presets. Profile
grouping remains available through the REST API and persisted group values are retained. In
Phase 2A, the dedicated Groups page, the Profiles table's Group column, and the
profile editor's group selector are hidden.
Launching a browser and pinning a preset to a device are the two things that
need the binary — the Settings screen says so when it is missing.

## Scripts

These live in `scripts/` and are for working on the project, not for daily use.

| Command | What it does |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `python scripts/build_webui.py` | Builds the Next.js UI as a static export and copies it into the package, so `camoufox-pm` can serve it. Needs Node.js 20.9+. |
| `python scripts/build_desktop.py` | Builds a standalone desktop bundle with PyInstaller that needs neither Python nor Node. See [accessibility-roadmap.md](accessibility-roadmap.md). |
| `python scripts/build_portable.py` | Builds the desktop bundle, then assembles the Windows portable edition (`FingerprintLite-<version>-windows-x64` + zip) with its `Data`/`Browser` folders and README. Refuses a bundle missing an entry point or the web UI. |
| `python examples/seed_demo.py` | Creates a handful of demo profiles for a look around. |

## Running from source without the console script

```bash
uv run python -m camoufox_pm.main
```

This starts the API with reload enabled and serves the UI if one has been built.
It reads `CPM_HOST` and `CPM_PORT` and takes no flags — `camoufox-pm` is the
supported entry point.

## Environment variables

Every setting is also an environment variable with the `CPM_` prefix; they are
listed in the [README](../README.md#configuration). A `.env` file in the working
directory is read automatically.

```bash
CPM_PORT=9000 CPM_API_KEY=secret camoufox-pm --no-browser
```
