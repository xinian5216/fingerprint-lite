# Profile settings

A profile's `browser_settings` control how Camoufox launches the browser. The
manager sets **high-level constraints** and lets Camoufox generate a consistent
fingerprint from them — it deliberately does not hand-pick the user agent or WebGL
renderer, because inconsistent values are easy to detect.

## Fields

## How settings reach the browser

`Profile.to_camoufox_launch_options()` builds the arguments passed to
`AsyncCamoufox`:

- Passed as launch parameters: `os`, `fonts`, `geoip`, `humanize`,
  `persistent_context`, `user_data_dir`, `proxy`, and `window` — the window size
  as a `(width, height)` tuple, not a `"1280x720"` string.
- `locale` is passed as the comma-joined `languages` list, which is the form
  Camoufox expects.
- `webrtc_mode: "none"` sets `block_webrtc=True`, which removes
  `RTCPeerConnection` from the page. The other modes leave WebRTC in place and
  let Camoufox report the proxy's address.
- Explicit overrides are emitted through Camoufox's `config` dict, using its
  property keys:
  - `geolocation:latitude`, `geolocation:longitude`, `geolocation:accuracy`
  - `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`, `navigator.maxTouchPoints`
  - `webrtc:ipv4`
  - `timezone`

Setting `geolocation` turns `geoip` off, so the coordinates are used as given
instead of being derived from the proxy's IP.

Camoufox owns canvas/WebGL/audio spoofing and the user agent, so those are not
set per-field here.

## The pinned machine

Camoufox resolves a fresh fingerprint on every launch. That suits a privacy tool,
but a profile manager needs the opposite: an account opened from a machine with
12 cores and an NVIDIA GPU must not come back tomorrow with 32 cores and an AMD
one. Without pinning, the same profile is measurably different hardware each
session — verified, and guarded by `tests/browser/test_fingerprint_stability.py`.

So the **first launch resolves the fingerprint once and stores it** on the
profile (the `fingerprint` column). Every later launch replays it. Camoufox fills
a config key only when it is absent, so a stored value always wins over a freshly
generated one, and the profile's own overrides still win over both.

Only the machine is frozen:

| Frozen — the identity | Dynamic — follows the proxy and the profile |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `navigator.*` (user agent, platform, CPU cores, oscpu) | `geolocation:*`, `timezone`, `locale:*` |
| `screen.*`, `window.*` geometry | `webrtc:*` |
| `webGl*` (vendor, renderer, parameters, extensions) | `navigator.language`, `navigator.languages` |
| `canvas:seed`, `audio:seed`, `fonts`, `fonts:spacing_seed` | `headers.*` |
| `mediaDevices:*`, `voices` | `window.history.length` |

Location and locale are deliberately left out: freezing them would pin a Berlin
timezone onto a profile that later moves to a Tokyo proxy, and a timezone that
contradicts the exit IP is easier to spot than no spoofing at all.

*Regenerate fingerprint* clears the pin, so the next launch assigns new hardware.
The pinned values are shown read-only in the profile form.

### Keeping a pin from going stale

A pin never ages by itself. A profile created on Firefox 152 still claims 152 a
year later, and a browser several releases behind is itself unusual — real
machines update.

*Update* in the Machine panel (or `POST /api/v1/profiles/{id}/refresh-browser`)
moves the pin onto the installed browser and changes **only** the browser
version. Screen, GPU, cores, fonts and the noise seeds stay exactly as they were,
which is what a real computer looks like after a browser update. The button
appears only when the pin is behind the browser on disk.

The user agent is resolved for the OS **the pin describes**, taken from its
`navigator.platform`, not from the profile's OS setting. The two can disagree if
someone changed the dropdown after the machine was pinned, and following the
setting would put a macOS browser on Windows hardware.

### When the OS setting and the machine disagree

The pin is what a page sees, so changing the `os` dropdown on a pinned profile
changes nothing observable — the setting simply stops meaning anything. That is
allowed (it is often the first step towards regenerating, and refusing it would
break bulk edits), but it is no longer silent: the profile response reports
`fingerprint.pinned_os`, `fingerprint.settings_os` and `fingerprint.os_mismatch`,
the server logs a warning on the save, the form says so under the dropdown, and
the Machine panel shows a banner offering the two ways out.

| | What it does | What it costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Keep this machine** | Puts the OS setting back to what the pin reports | Nothing — no fingerprint value changes |
| **New \<OS\> machine** | Pins a fresh machine resolved for the OS setting | New screen, GPU, cores, fonts and noise seeds; a warmed-up account is now on different hardware |

Neither is preselected, and `POST /api/v1/profiles/{id}/reconcile-os` refuses when
the two already agree, so a stale screen cannot replace the hardware of a healthy
profile.

## Where the profile appears to be

A pinned machine keeps the hardware honest. Geography is the other half, and it
is deliberately **not** pinned: a profile that keeps a Berlin timezone after
moving to a Tokyo proxy contradicts itself in a way any page can measure with two
lines of JavaScript.

So a new profile is created without a timezone and without coordinates, and
Camoufox derives both — plus the WebRTC address — from where the proxy comes out.
Set either field only when you want to override that.

Setting **coordinates** is the exception worth understanding. Camoufox overwrites
the geolocation keys from the exit address whenever its IP lookup is on, so the
only way to keep coordinates is to turn that lookup off — and the same branch is
what fills the timezone and the WebRTC address. This manager therefore fills
those two itself, from the same address and the same database Camoufox would have
used. Without that, Firefox falls back to *this computer's* timezone: measured,
a profile with Tokyo coordinates reported `Europe/Moscow`, the host's own zone.

Profiles created before this behaviour keep the timezone and coordinates they
were given, and those were picked from a random region. They are still not
migrated automatically — changing a stored fingerprint under a live account is
worse than leaving it — but the change is offered:

- **In the profile form**, under Geolocation, whenever the saved profile states a
  timezone or coordinates: *Clear both, follow the proxy*.
- **In the profiles list**, as a bulk action on the current selection. The button
  counts how many of the selected profiles actually state a location, so it says
  what it will really change.
- **`POST /api/v1/profiles/clear-geography`** with `{"profile_ids": [...]}`, which
  is what both use.

**There is no attempt to guess which values were chosen on purpose.** Nothing
recorded it, and the only distinguishable signal — values matching the old
generator's region table — is exactly what someone who deliberately picked that
city would have produced. So the action is offered wherever geography is set,
explained, and never applied on its own.

Only the timezone and the coordinates are cleared. Languages and `locale` are
left alone: Camoufox applies languages after its IP lookup regardless, an
English-language browser is unremarkable from any country, and changing them
would alter the profile's identity rather than free it to follow the proxy.

Clearing the coordinates is the part that matters beyond tidiness. Their presence
forces `geoip=False`, and that same branch is what fills the timezone and the
WebRTC address, so a profile carrying a random region derives none of the three
from its proxy. With both cleared, `geoip` is back on and all three follow the
exit address.

### Checking a proxy

*Check proxy* in the profile form (and in a profile's row menu) reaches the
internet through the proxy and reports the address it comes out at, the country
and timezone that address resolves to, and the round trip. It then lists anything
a page could notice:

| Reported as | When |
| --- | --- |
| Error | The profile cannot launch at all — SOCKS with credentials, which Firefox refuses |
| Warning | A page can see the contradiction: a timezone on a different clock, or coordinates more than 500 km from the exit |
| Note | Worth knowing, not detectable as a conflict: a different zone name on the same clock, or coordinates in a nearby city |

The check reads the form as it is on screen, so a proxy can be tested — and a
mismatch fixed and re-tested — before anything is saved.

## Real device presets

Camoufox bundles fingerprints captured from actual machines — 180 Windows, 67
macOS and 65 Linux at the time of writing. A generated fingerprint is internally
consistent but still an assembly of parts; a preset is a combination that
genuinely exists.

Pick one when creating a profile (the form lists them by screen, CPU count and
GPU) and the profile is pinned to that device immediately. `GET
/api/v1/fingerprints/presets` returns the catalogue; ids look like `windows:42` and
are only a selector — the resolved fingerprint is stored, so a Camoufox update
that reshuffles the catalogue cannot move an existing profile.

A preset defines the hardware, so values the profile would otherwise generate
(CPU count, screen) are cleared when one is chosen. Values you set explicitly
still win.

## Moving a profile

`GET /api/v1/profiles/{id}/export` packs the profile record, its pinned fingerprint
and its browser data directory into a single zip; `POST /api/v1/profiles/import`
restores it under a new id. In the UI: *Export…* in a profile's row menu, and the
import button in the toolbar.

This is the only way to move an account without losing it. A warmed-up profile is
mostly its cookies, storage and history — exporting the settings alone would move
the costume without the memory.

- The browser must be closed. Exporting a running profile is refused (409),
  because its databases would be copied mid-write.
- Disposable caches are excluded, which is most of the size: a 51 MB profile
  packs to about 16 MB.
- **The archive is not encrypted.** It contains live session cookies, saved
  logins and the proxy password, so it is exactly as sensitive as the account it
  belongs to.

## Known limitations

These are properties of Camoufox and Firefox, not of this manager:

- **The canvas hash changes between sessions, by default.** Measured on
  Camoufox 152:

  | Scope | Canvas hash |
  | ----- | ----------- |
  | Two tabs, same site, one session | **the same** |
  | Different sites, one session | different — deliberate, and what stops sites correlating you across the web |
  | Same site, same profile, next launch | **different every time** |

  The first two are what a privacy browser should do. The third is the problem: a
  real browser returns the same canvas to a site for years, so a site that records
  it sees a new machine every session.

  What is randomised is **image export** — `toDataURL()` and `toBlob()` — from a
  2D *or* a WebGL canvas. Raw pixel readback (`getImageData`, `readPixels`) is
  stable, and so is `measureText`.

  `canvas:seed` is listed as a supported property but is **not honoured**: pinning
  it changes nothing. It is declared in Camoufox's property manifest and emitted
  by its Python layer, but its C++ config reader never reads it, and no patch in
  the repository implements it. `window.setCanvasSeed()`, documented in Camoufox's
  per-context notes, is `undefined` in the shipped build while its siblings
  (`setNavigatorUserAgent`, `setWebGLVendor`) are defined. Both are worth fixing
  upstream, and the seed is the better long-term mechanism because it would give
  each profile its own canvas value rather than one shared true render.

  **The `stable_canvas` setting turns this off, and it is a genuine trade.**
  Enabling it launches with `privacy.baselineFingerprintingProtection = false`,
  which stops the pixel randomisation; combined with the pinned
  `fonts:spacing_seed` a profile already stores, the canvas becomes fully
  reproducible. Both halves are needed — text rendering follows the font seed
  rather than the canvas path, so the pref alone leaves a text-bearing canvas
  drifting. Measured:

  | | Same site, relaunched | Different sites |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `stable_canvas` off (default) | different every launch | different |
  | `stable_canvas` on | **identical** | **identical** |

  The right-hand column is the cost: a stable canvas is the same everywhere, so
  two sites can tell they are looking at one machine. That is exactly what real
  hardware does, and exactly what the randomisation existed to prevent.

  Choose per profile. One long-lived account wants it on, because looking like
  new hardware every visit is the bigger tell. Browsing the open web unlinkably
  wants the default. Set it in the profile form under **Canvas**, or as
  `browser_settings.stable_canvas` through the API.
- **`max_touch_points` has no effect.** Camoufox 152 lists
  `navigator.maxTouchPoints` as a supported property but does not apply it; the
  page keeps reporting `0` on every OS, with or without the touch-events pref.
  The field is stored so it starts working if upstream does.
- **`screen` is not sent to the browser.** It is generated, stored and shown, but
  Camoufox derives the real screen metrics itself.
- **SOCKS proxies cannot use credentials.** Firefox refuses to authenticate to a
  SOCKS proxy, so a profile with a SOCKS proxy plus a username or password fails
  to launch. Use HTTP/HTTPS for authenticated proxies.
- **Changing `os` does not recompute the rest.** Screen size, locale and fonts
  keep their previous values; use *Regenerate fingerprint* for a consistent set.
