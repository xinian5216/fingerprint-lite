# REST API reference

The API is the same one the web UI uses. A running instance serves interactive
documentation at **`/docs`** (Swagger) and **`/redoc`**, generated from the code —
that is the authoritative schema. This page is the guided tour, and the
[stability contract](#stability-contract) below is what we promise to keep.

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default. Endpoints live under **`/api/v1`**.

The unversioned `/api/...` paths that predate 0.2.0 keep working as aliases — same
routes, same behaviour — but are left out of the OpenAPI schema so a generated
client sees each operation once. New code should use `/api/v1`.

## Authentication

Two independent mechanisms, either of which satisfies the guard on every
`/api/...` route. Which ones are active follows from what is configured — there
is no separate auth switch:

1. **Nothing configured** (no users, no `CPM_API_KEY`): the API is open. This is
   the default, and it is fine because the app binds to loopback.
2. **`CPM_API_KEY` set**: every request must carry the key — the
   machine-to-machine path, unchanged from before user accounts existed:

   ```bash
   curl -H "X-API-Key: $CPM_API_KEY" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/profiles
   ```

   The key is compared in constant time. The web UI can send it too — paste it
   into the Settings screen, which stores it in that browser only.
3. **Any user account exists** (`camoufox-pm user add <name>`): the API requires
   a login session — or the API key, so machine clients keep working the day a
   human account is created. The web UI shows a login screen; other clients call
   `POST /api/v1/auth/login` and carry the `cpm_session` cookie it sets. There
   is no registration endpoint: accounts are created from the CLI, which
   requires shell access to the host.

**Configure at least one of them before binding to anything other than
`127.0.0.1`.** Without either, anybody who can reach the port can read your
profiles, including proxy passwords.

### Login sessions

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/login       {"username": "...", "password": "..."}
POST /api/v1/auth/logout
GET  /api/v1/auth/session
```

These three are the only unauthenticated API routes — login has to work logged
out, and `GET /auth/session` is how the UI decides whether to show the login
screen. Login and `GET /auth/session` answer
`{user_auth_enabled, authenticated, username}`; login additionally sets the
session cookie. Logout returns the action envelope and clears the cookie.

- A successful login sets `cpm_session`: **HttpOnly** (invisible to page
  scripts), **SameSite=Lax**, `Path=/`, and **Secure** when the request came
  over HTTPS or `CPM_SECURE_COOKIES=1`. It expires after `CPM_SESSION_TTL_HOURS`
  (default 168, one week).
- The session is server-side: the database stores only a SHA-256 of the token,
  and logout deletes the row, so a logged-out token is dead even if replayed.
- A failed login is a `401` with the same body whether the username exists or
  the password is wrong, costs an argon2 verification either way, and is
  delayed half a second.
- Passwords are hashed with argon2id; no response or log ever carries a
  password or a hash.

## Conventions

- Request and response bodies are JSON, except file upload and download.
- Resource endpoints return the resource itself. Action and system endpoints
  that have no resource to return use the envelope
  `{"success": bool, "message": str, "data": ...}`.
- **A field you send is authoritative, including `null`, which clears it. A field
  you omit is left alone.** This matters most on `PUT /api/v1/profiles/{id}`:
  send `{"proxy_config": null}` to detach a proxy; omit the key to leave it.
- Statuses: `400` for a bad request, `401` for missing or wrong credentials
  (API key or login session), `404` for a missing resource, `405` for a method
  the path does not accept, `409` for a state conflict, `422` for values that
  fail validation, `500` otherwise. `409` covers several conflicts, so it always
  carries a code that says which: `stale_write` when someone else saved the
  profile first, `conflict` for a profile that is running or leased elsewhere.

### Errors

Every non-2xx response from an `/api` route has one shape (`/health` is the
exception — see [System](#system)):

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "not_found",
    "message": "Profile with ID x1 not found",
    "details": null
  },
  "detail": "Profile with ID x1 not found"
}
```

- `error.code` is a stable snake_case token: `bad_request`, `unauthorized`,
  `not_found`, `method_not_allowed`, `conflict`, `validation_error`,
  `internal_error`.
- `error.message` is always a single human-readable string — including for
  validation failures, which used to arrive as a list.
- `error.details` carries the structured specifics when there are any; for
  validation failures it is pydantic's error list, each entry with `loc`,
  `msg` and `type`.
- `detail` mirrors `error.message` for clients written against FastAPI's
  default shape. It is deprecated and goes away in 1.0; read `error.message`.

## Stability contract

`1.0` freezes, for the whole `1.x` line:

- the `/api/v1` paths, methods and status codes documented here;
- the names and types of every documented request and response field —
  fields are only ever *added*, never renamed or removed;
- the error shape above and its `error.code` values;
- the pagination shape on `GET /api/v1/profiles`.

New endpoints, new optional parameters and new response fields are **not**
breaking changes and can appear in any release. Anything that would break the
above waits for a `/api/v2`, at which point `/api/v1` keeps working.

Deliberately **outside** the contract, at 1.0 and after:

- the contents of the `fingerprint` summary on a profile — its values come from
  Camoufox's fingerprint catalogue and change when Camoufox does;
- `camoufox_options` in the launch response — launch internals, exposed for
  debugging;
- the entries of `actions` in profile statistics;
- the preset fields beyond `id` and `os` — they describe whatever Camoufox's
  captured devices carry.

### Deprecated, removed in 1.0

Everything here works throughout `0.2.x` and is marked deprecated in the
OpenAPI schema:

| Deprecated                                        | Use instead                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Flattened `browser_*` fields on profile update    | the same keys in `browser_settings`  |
| `browser_session_id` in the launch response       | `profile_id` (it addresses the browser); the id was a random value nothing accepted |
| Top-level `detail` in error responses             | `error.message`                      |

The unversioned `/api/...` aliases outlive 1.0 — scripts against them keep
working for the whole `1.x` line — and are removed in 2.0.

## Profiles

### List

```http
GET /api/v1/profiles?page=1&per_page=25&status=active&group=<id>&search=shop
```

Returns `{profiles, total, page, per_page, has_next, has_prev}`. `search` matches
the name. This is the only paginated collection: groups and browsers stay small,
so those lists are returned whole.

### Create

```http
POST /api/v1/profiles
```

```json
{
  "name": "shop-de-01",
  "group": "<group id>",
  "notes": "free text",
  "generate_fingerprint": true,
  "fingerprint_preset": "windows:42",
  "browser_settings": {
    "os": "windows",
    "timezone": "Europe/Berlin",
    "languages": ["de-DE", "de"],
    "hardware_concurrency": 8,
    "window_width": 1280,
    "window_height": 720,
    "webrtc_mode": "replace",
    "geolocation": {"lat": 52.52, "lon": 13.405}
  },
  "proxy_config": {
    "type": "socks5", "server": "host:1080",
    "username": "u", "password": "p"
  }
}
```

Only `name` is required. Everything under `browser_settings` that you leave out is
generated as a consistent fingerprint.

`fingerprint_preset` pins the profile to a real device from
`GET /api/v1/fingerprints/presets`; the preset then defines the hardware, so
values it owns are not also generated. This needs the browser installed and
returns `400` if it is not, rather than creating a profile with a different
machine than the one asked for.

Responds `201` with the profile, including a `fingerprint` summary once one is
pinned.

### Read, update, delete

```http
GET    /api/v1/profiles/{id}
PUT    /api/v1/profiles/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/profiles/{id}
```

`PUT` takes the same shape as create. `browser_settings` is **merged** over what
is stored, so sending one field does not reset the rest of the fingerprint. The
older flattened form (`browser_os`, `browser_timezone`, …) still works and is
merged the same way, but is deprecated — it goes away in 1.0.

#### Not overwriting someone else's save

Every profile carries a `row_version`, bumped by each save. Send back the one you
read and a save that landed in between is refused with **`409`** and the code
`stale_write`, instead of silently reverting it:

```http
PUT /api/v1/profiles/{id}    {"notes": "...", "row_version": 7}
```

```json
{"error": {"code": "stale_write",
           "message": "Profile … was changed by someone else since it was read; reload it and apply the edit again"}}
```

Reload the profile, decide what to do with the difference, and retry against the
`row_version` that comes back. The refusal writes nothing, so nothing is
half-applied.

Omitting `row_version` keeps the previous behaviour and stays supported: the
server then guards only against two requests overlapping, which cannot know about
an edit made against a form loaded minutes ago. Sending it is what protects a
long-lived form.

Not every write bumps the version. A proxy check and a browser launch write only
the columns they own — `proxy_check`, and the pinned machine with `last_used` —
precisely so that a thirty-second proxy check or a launch does not make every open
edit form fail to save. The consequence is that those writes cannot be guarded
this way either; nothing else in the API writes a profile without a version.

### Other actions

```http
POST /api/v1/profiles/{id}/clone              {"new_name": "...", "regenerate_fingerprint": true}
POST /api/v1/profiles/{id}/reset-fingerprint
GET  /api/v1/profiles/{id}/stats
```

A clone gets **its own machine**, not a copy of the source's. `regenerate_fingerprint`
defaults to true, which drops the pinned fingerprint so the copy's first launch
resolves a new one — two profiles sharing a pin would report the same GPU, screen,
core count and noise seeds forever, which is provably one computer. Pass
`{"regenerate_fingerprint": false}` to copy the machine as well, and know what you
are asking for.

`reset-fingerprint` generates new settings **and drops the pinned machine**, so
the next launch assigns fresh hardware.

```http
POST /api/v1/profiles/{id}/refresh-browser
```

Moves the pinned machine onto the installed browser version, changing only the
browser: the hardware and the noise seeds are kept. Use it when a profile's pin
has fallen behind the browser on disk — `fingerprint.browser_outdated` in the
profile response says when. Returns `400` if the profile has no pin yet.

The response's `fingerprint` summary carries `browser_major`, `installed_major`
and `browser_outdated` so a client does not have to parse the user agent.

```http
POST /api/v1/profiles/{id}/reconcile-os     {"keep_machine": true}
```

Brings a profile's `os` setting and its pinned machine back into agreement. The
summary reports the disagreement as `pinned_os`, `settings_os` and `os_mismatch`.

- `keep_machine: true` sets `os` to what the pin reports and changes **no**
  fingerprint value.
- `keep_machine: false` pins a machine resolved for the `os` setting instead —
  new screen, GPU, cores, fonts and noise seeds, and `browser_settings.screen` is
  updated to match.

`400` when the profile has no pin, when the pin's OS cannot be read, or when the
two already agree — regenerating hardware is irreversible for an account, so a
stale client cannot trigger it by accident.

```http
POST /api/v1/profiles/clear-geography    {"profile_ids": ["a1b2c3d4", ...]}
```

Unsets `timezone` and `geolocation` on each profile named, so Camoufox derives
both — and the WebRTC address — from where that profile's proxy comes out, as a
profile created today does. Languages and `locale` are not touched. Returns
`cleared`, `unchanged` (already followed the proxy) and `not_found`, so a bulk
call reports itself; `422` for an empty list.

## Checking a proxy

```http
POST /api/v1/profiles/{id}/check-proxy
POST /api/v1/proxy/check      {"proxy_config": {...}, "browser_settings": {...}}
```

Both reach the internet through the proxy and return the same shape: `reachable`,
`error`, `latency_ms`, the `location` it comes out at (`ip`, `country`,
`timezone`, `latitude`, `longitude`) and a list of `findings`, each with a
`level` of `error`, `warning` or `info`, the `field` it concerns and a message.

A proxy that does not answer is reported with `reachable: false` and an `error`,
not raised as a 5xx. The second form takes an unsaved proxy, which is what the
profile form uses so a proxy can be checked before the profile exists; omit
`proxy_config` to check the direct connection.

Checking a **saved** profile also keeps the answer on it, so the profiles list can
show a proxy's last state without asking again. It comes back as `proxy_check` on
the profile — `checked_at`, `reachable`, `error`, `latency_ms`, `ip`, `country`,
`timezone` and the same `findings` — and as `checked_at` on the check response
itself. It is `null` until the profile is checked, and again whenever its proxy
changes, because an answer from the previous proxy says nothing about the new one.
Nothing writes it but a check that was asked for; there is no polling.

## Running browsers

```http
POST /api/v1/profiles/{id}/launch    {"headless": false, "window_size": "1280x720"}
POST /api/v1/profiles/{id}/close
GET  /api/v1/browsers/active
POST /api/v1/browsers/close-all
```

Launch responds with `status` (`launched`, or `already_running` if the profile's
browser is already up), a `message` and the `process_id`. Closing a browser that
is not running is a no-op reported as `status: "not_running"`, not an error.

The first launch of a profile resolves its fingerprint and stores it; every
launch after replays it. Closing the browser window yourself is detected and the
session is cleaned up, so `/api/v1/browsers/active` reflects reality without
polling the process table.

Launching a profile that another instance has open returns **`409`**. Each
launch takes a lease on the profile, and `/api/v1/browsers/active` only sees
this instance's browsers — the lease is what one instance knows about another's.
Retry once the holder closes the browser, or wait out `CPM_LEASE_TTL` if that
instance is gone. There is no force-unlock endpoint: releasing another
instance's lease needs `camoufox-pm unlock` on the host.

## Moving a profile

```http
GET  /api/v1/profiles/{id}/export      → application/zip
POST /api/v1/profiles/import[?name=…]  multipart: file=<archive.zip>
```

The archive carries the profile, its pinned fingerprint and its browser data
(cookies, storage, history, saved logins). Import assigns a new id, so an archive
can be restored next to the profile it came from.

- Exporting a **running** profile returns `409` — its databases would be copied
  mid-write. A profile leased by another instance is refused the same way, for
  the same reason.
- The archive is **not encrypted** and holds live session cookies and the proxy
  password. Treat it like the account itself.

## Device presets

```http
GET /api/v1/fingerprints/presets?os=windows
```

The fingerprints Camoufox captured from real machines. This one is wrapped in
the action envelope: the catalogue arrives as `data.presets`, each entry
`{id, os, screen, hardware_concurrency, gpu, vendor, user_agent}`, alongside
`data.total`. Pass an `id` as `fingerprint_preset` when creating a profile.

The catalogue reads without the browser installed; pinning one does not.

## Schedules

```http
GET    /api/v1/schedules
POST   /api/v1/schedules
GET    /api/v1/schedules/{id}
PUT    /api/v1/schedules/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/schedules/{id}
POST   /api/v1/schedules/{id}/run
GET    /api/v1/schedules/{id}/runs
```

A schedule runs one of two actions against a profile: `launch` (open its
browser; `run_minutes` optionally closes it again that many minutes later) or
`refresh_browser` (move its pinned fingerprint onto the installed browser
version, hardware untouched). Regenerating the hardware fingerprint is
deliberately **not** schedulable — it would make the profile a new machine on a
timer, which is what the pin exists to prevent; see
[scheduling.md](scheduling.md).

```json
{
  "profile_id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "action": "launch",
  "kind": "daily",
  "at_time": "09:00",
  "days": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
  "run_minutes": 15
}
```

- `kind` is `"interval"` with `interval_minutes`, or `"daily"` with `at_time`
  (`HH:MM`, 24-hour, read on the **server's** clock) and optional `days`
  (weekdays the schedule fires, `0` = Monday … `6` = Sunday; omitted = every
  day). A body whose fields do not match its `kind` fails validation.
- Creating against an unknown profile returns `400`. Deleting a profile deletes
  its schedules.
- The response carries `profile_name`, the planned `next_run_at` and the
  `last_run`, so a client does not join these itself.

`PUT` updates a schedule; omitted fields are left alone, and changing the
timing (or re-enabling) recomputes `next_run_at` from now. `enabled: false`
pauses a schedule without losing it.

`POST .../run` executes the action immediately, records the outcome, and does
**not** move the planned next run; it works on a paused schedule too. The run
record is returned:

```json
{"schedule_id": "x9y8z7w6", "outcome": "ok", "message": "Browser launched", ...}
```

`GET .../runs` lists the newest runs, newest first; the last 20 are kept per
schedule. `outcome` is `ok`, `skipped` (the browser was already running),
`error` (the message says why), or `missed` — the run fell due while the app
was not running and was skipped, never replayed.

## Groups

```http
GET    /api/v1/groups
POST   /api/v1/groups            {"name": "Client A", "description": "..."}
GET    /api/v1/groups/{id}
PUT    /api/v1/groups/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/groups/{id}
```

Deleting a group keeps its profiles; they become ungrouped.

## System

```http
GET  /health                                liveness and database state
GET  /api/v1/system/status                  counts, load, memory, disk, uptime
GET  /api/v1/system/info                    name, version, uptime
GET  /api/v1/system/config                  effective configuration, no secret values
GET  /api/v1/system/profiles/diagnostic     profiles whose storage looks wrong
POST /api/v1/system/profiles/cleanup        remove orphaned profile directories
POST /api/v1/system/restart                 close all browsers, ready for a restart
```

`/health` is deliberately unversioned, so probes survive API versions. An
unhealthy instance answers with the same body under a `503`, so a load balancer
or container healthcheck sees the failure without parsing anything.

`/api/v1/system/config` reports whether encryption, the API key and user login
are on, the bind address, the database path and whether the browser is
installed — it never returns the values of secrets. It backs the Settings
screen.

`/api/v1/system/restart` does **not** restart the process; it closes every
browser so you can restart it cleanly yourself.

## Example: create a profile and run it

```bash
API=http://localhost:8000

ID=$(curl -s -X POST $API/api/v1/profiles \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"name":"demo","browser_settings":{"os":"windows"}}' \
      | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["id"])')

curl -s -X POST $API/api/v1/profiles/$ID/launch \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"headless":false}'

curl -s $API/api/v1/browsers/active
curl -s -X POST $API/api/v1/profiles/$ID/close
```
